extra info maps contain different data stored in the different color channels of the texture
for example we have maps that store
1. specular map (shininess) -> red channel
2. glow (diffuse scale) -> green channel

to generate the map I used gimp what i did is:
open the channels tab in the toolbox that has layers etc
right click on a layer and choose "Channel to selection" 
then you can use the brush to paint only into this channel is seems
to fill a channel with black you can do the channle to selection and then apply a black bucket fill a couple of times

with this technique you seem to need to paint over (reapply the color) multiple times for some reason so it probably isnt entirely correct
but it seems to be at least good for creating an outline that you can later color when you fill another channel with black

this advice from stack sounds better but i havent tested it:

Probably your best bet is to open a new image, then use Colours > Components > Decompose. This will turn the channels into editable layers named red, green, blue, and open the result as a new greyscale image in a new tab for you to edit.

Once you have finished editing these layers, click Colours > Components > Recompose, and the other image open in the tabs along the top will update.

Here's a screenshot showing each channel with different content, edited using decompose then recompose. Obviously if you want masks, you'd need to invert each of the RGB layers, like this example.
