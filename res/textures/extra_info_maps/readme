extra info maps contain different data stored in the different color channels of the texture
for example we have maps that store
1. specular map (shininess) -> red channel
2. glow (diffuse scale) -> green channel

to generate the map I used gimp what i did is:
open the channels tab in the toolbox that has layers etc
right click on a layer and choose "Channel to selection" 
then you can use the brush to paint only into this channel is seems
to fill a channel with black you can do the channle to selection and then apply a black bucket fill a couple of times

with this technique you seem to need to paint over (reapply the color) multiple times for some reason so it probably isnt entirely correct
but it seems to be at least good for creating an outline that you can later color when you fill another channel with black
